As I've mentioned in a [previous post]({% post_url
2024-07-15-my-journey-with-rust %}), I am on a mission to rebuild a tool called
`kw patch-hub` using Rust. My experience with `kw patch-hub` started with my
[GSoC23 project]({% post_url 2023-08-26-gsoc23-final-report %}), and I found
learning Rust, an excellent opportunity to rebuild it, as it had practically
halted its development due to many issues. This posts describes how this rebuild
is going, my assessment of it, and how the new `kw patch-hub` is shaping up.

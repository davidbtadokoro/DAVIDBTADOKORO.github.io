Welcome! My name is David, and I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/).
For all of my life, I found technology hypnotizing. But, for the past four years, I've had the pleasure of learning
all things computer related.

Building a virtual processor, designing and implementing a network protocol to play tic-tac-toe, writing a monography
on Spectre and Meltdown, and sharpening my mathematical proof skills (admittedly, not my favorite) are just some of the
many incredible things I superficially came across.

However, I've been diving deep into subjects like Operating Systems (OSes), Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS)
projects, and the Linux kernel, all kickstarted by the [Kworkflow](https://kworkflow.org) project, which I've been
contributing to in the last year or so.

If any of this sounds interesting, I invite you to read through this website/personal blog, where I get to write about
this spectacular world of computers.
